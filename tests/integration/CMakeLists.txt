# Integration tests for multi-component interactions

# Placeholder for integration test sources
# Tests that verify interactions between Fortran kernels and C runtime

# If sources exist, they would be added here:
# set(INTEGRATION_TEST_SOURCES
#     test_fortran_c_interface.c
#     test_worker_integration.c
# )
# add_test_executable(integration_tests "${INTEGRATION_TEST_SOURCES}"
