# src/coordinator/CMakeLists.txt
# Builds the task coordination and scheduling subsystem

# Placeholder for coordinator sources
# This directory will contain the distributed task scheduler and coordinator logic

# If sources exist, they would be added here:
# set(COORDINATOR_SOURCES
#     scheduler.c
#     task_dispatch.c
#     coordinator.c
# )

# For now, just document the expected structure
