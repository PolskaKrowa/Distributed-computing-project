# src/worker/CMakeLists.txt
# Builds the worker node orchestration subsystem

# Placeholder for worker sources
# This directory will contain the worker process management and task execution logic

# If sources exist, they would be added here:
# set(WORKER_SOURCES
#     worker_process.c
#     task_executor.c
#     resource_monitor.c
# )

# For now, just document the expected structure
